# Phase 1: Final Project

# Project Title: STEPHANIE'S JOKE GENERATOR 

# WHAT INSPIRED MY PROJECT
Being an aunt is one of the funnest roles !!

My nephews love jokes, so I decided to create a CLEAN joke application for them! 

I haven't been able to spend much time with them due to this software engineering program, so I thought that by choosing a theme for my app that they might be interested in, then I'd be able to show them why their aunt has been so busy! 

# WHAT DOES MY APPLICATION DO
* This application generates CLEAN jokes from a public API
* It allows you to add and save your favorite jokes to a list
* You are able to see that list separately
* In case you change your mind about a joke you favorited, it allows you to remove and DELETE a specific joke :) 

### How to use
* Fork and clone
* In your terminal: $ json-server --watch db.json 
* Open the index.html
    From here, you should be able to follow instructions on html page to view, save, and delete saved jokes.

### SOME CHALLENGES I FACED
I had a hard time getting my favorited list to show as soon as a specific joke was favorited. I also had a hard time getting my favorited jokes to delete permanently on my db.json. The CRUD videos on Canvas REALLY helped!
